# RULE #1 ZERO-SHAME POLICY

-  Stop casual shames
	- has shaming yourself ever mode you more productive?
- Times does not = productivity, self worth does not = productivity
- treat yourself the way you would your own biz bestie
- isn't the flexibility & freedom why you become self-employed?
- also: nothing is urgent.

# RULE #2 OPTIMIZATION

- if you're not clear on this, money ends up being your default
- be careful about what you optimize for because chances are you'll get it
- what "actually" is this for for -- for you?

# RULE #3 CONSTRAINTS

- money constraints: what is enough? 
	- infinite growth is not sustainable or realistic 
- work constraints: set your 'big 3' each day  
- energy constraints: "did I do my best for today?" 
- time constraints: hard boundaries around time

# RULE #4 LIFE > WORK

- if you're overly invested, you ride the emotional rollercoaster every day
- detach your identity from your work completely
- diversify your identity- me and my work used to be the same circle
